Daniel here, I'm a wanna-be revolutionary trying to make by in a Capitalist economy while he searches for a grander vision.
Love to travel, fluent in Spanish. Traveling for me is primarily an opportunity to explore my Self in different and ever-stimulating environments. 
 
  How will I react to unfavorable circumstances when I'm all alone?
  How will I learn to create relationships when I lack all entry points save my own voice?
  How do I make other people feel about me, and themselves, after meeting me? Is life a more magical place now?
  How will I adapt to changing environments, will I learn to camoflage myself? To embody local custom? Or will I seek to stand apart, to stand out even in the face of conflict, if it means being authentic?
  
Coding is an opportunity to spend more time with me. I think.
